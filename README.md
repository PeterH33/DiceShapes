# DiceShapes
Experiments in making simple dice shapes programatically to allow for infinite scaling and accessibility. 

This is a work in progress for another app, I am just leaving the experiments public in case anyone else might want to use similar swiftui code in a project. Feel free to read the code and implement what you want in your own project.
